1. You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
This can be biased because advertising in February will be less in effective in May because of the weather. In February, bathing sales will not be high because the weather will be lower compared to May where the weather will be warmer.

2. You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
This is biased because if the focus is people with anxiety then of course the patients will show a higher rate of anxiety compared to the general population.

3. You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
This can be biased because we are not sure whetre these people are coming from. If the website has a sign up option, we could ask to see how they heard about the company to determine of they were brought in from the billboard ads.


4. You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
This is biased because the loyalty program relies on loyal customers. We need more time than just one week in order to see potential loyalty from customers.
